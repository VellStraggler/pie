## Overview

**Project Title**:
Pie Chart Agenda

**Project Description**:
A mobile app, which will be compatible on IOS and Android, displays an agenda in a pie-chart format, following the 15-minute segments on a clock. It will allows you to write tasks and whole days that can auto-repeat, and it allows for easy task-editing and multiple views of the clock.

**Project Goals**:
To create a usable, professional, and easy-to-use application that helps keep a daily agenda.
